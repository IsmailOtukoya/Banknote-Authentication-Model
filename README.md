# Banknote-Authentication-Model
Banknote Authentication model

This example aims to detect fraudulent notes accurately.

A set of images taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens is created. Features such as wavelet variance, wavelet skewness, wavelet kurtosis, and image entropy are extracted from the images. Using A set of methods such as K-nearest neighbors, Logistic regression, Support vector machines, random forests, decision tree. After which the models are compared using a set of metrics.
